# Tibia commands
##/whois *playerName/discordUser*
*Other aliases: /check, /player, /checkplayer, /char, /character*

This commands has 2 functions:
* It retrieves and displays info about a Tibia character
* It retrieves the list of characters linked to a discord user

If the parameter matches a discord user, it displays a list of the characters linked to that user. If the parameter matches a character, it will display the character's info, such as level, vocation, guild, world, etc.

If the character found is registered to a discord user, it will show the owner of the character.

Both cases can match simultaneously.


####Example:
>/whois Galarzaa Fidera<br>
>**Galarzaa Fidera** is a character of **@Galarzaa**.<br>
>**Galarzaa Fidera** is a level 186 __Royal Paladin__. He resides in __Roshamuul__ in the world __Fidera__.<br>
>He is __Leader__ of the **Redd Alliance**.<br>

In this case, it matched *Galarzaa Fidera* to a character, and that character is registered to user @Galarzaa

>/whois Galarzaa<br>
>**@Galarzaa**'s characters are: Galarzaa Fidera (Lvl 186 RP), Galarzaa The Druid (Lvl 101 ED), Galarzaa Redd (Lvl 26 EK) and Galarzaa Deathbringer (Lvl 10 S).<br>
>The character **Galarzaa** is a level 25 __Knight__. He resides in __Venore__ in the world __Calmera__.

In this case, Galarzaa matches the discord user @Galarzaa, so a list of his registered characters is displayed. However, it also matches the character *Galarzaa* which may not be necessarily related to the user.
